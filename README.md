# FateConditions
Requires NicK East's Fate Core system.

To use, simply create an Extra on a character with a name that contains the word Condition (or condition) in any format, and ends with an underscore and a number.
When you save the extra, it will immediately be populated with a set of checkboxes equal to the number after the underscore and the name will be changed to remove the underscore and the number.
Don't use more than one underscore in your condition name or this won't work.
